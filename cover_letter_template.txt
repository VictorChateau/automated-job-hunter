Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the ### role at ===.

In the jobs I have had while studying, I have always worked closely with people. My first job as a Dispatch Coordinator involved working directly with clients to organise deliveries tailored to their needs. My next position as a Resident Advisor at the University of Auckland required me to liaise with students and University staff while working with my team to monitor community wellbeing and organise events. Additionally, I have done graphical work for several small businesses and used frequent discussions to deliver highly personalised designs.

Each of these environments has required receptiveness to feedback, a can-do approach to problem-solving and a strong willingness to learn. 

Now that I have completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, I am excited to the world of development and eager to put my coding skills to use in a professional setting. I would love to meet the === team and to discuss the position in greater detail. 

Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you. 

Sincerely,
Victor Chateau
